        <h2>1985-Present</h2>
        <h2>THE GREATEST FOOTBALLER EVER</h2>
        <h3>
          Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese
          pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a
          Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A
          club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team. Often
          considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of
          the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballons
          d'Or[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, both of which are records
          for a European player.

        Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing
        for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18.
        After winning the FA Cup in his first season, he helped United win three
        successive Premier League titles, the Champions League, and the FIFA
        Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. In 2009,
        Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football
        transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth €94 million
        (£80 million). There, he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles,
        two Copas del Rey, and four Champions League titles, and became the
        club's all-time top goalscorer. After joining Madrid, Ronaldo finished
        runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three times, behind Lionel Messi – his
        perceived career rival – before winning back-to-back Ballons d'Or from
        2013–2014 and again from 2016–2017. After winning a third consecutive
        Champions League title in 2018, Ronaldo became the first player to win
        the trophy five times. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer
        worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the highest fee ever paid
        by an Italian club and the highest ever paid for a player over 30 years
        old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana and a Coppa
        Italia in his first three seasons with the club. Ronaldo made his senior
        international debut for Portugal in 2003 at age 18, and has since earned
        over 170 caps, including appearing and scoring in eleven major
        tournaments, becoming Portugal's most capped player and his country's
        all-time top goalscorer. He scored his first international goal at Euro
        2004 where he helped Portugal reach the final and assumed full captaincy
        of the national team in July 2008. In 2015 Ronaldo was named the best
        Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The
        following year he led Portugal to their first triumph in a major
        tournament by winning Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the
        second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. One of the most marketable
        and famous athletes in the world, Ronaldo was ranked the world's
        highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most
        famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their
        list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the
        first footballer, as well as only the third sportsman, to earn $1
        billion in their career.
